Rust WIP Vulkan RTS Game 
(think of WC2 / WC3 / StarCraft / C&C / Spellforce etc.)

***teaching myself Rust and Vulkan besides Studies of Geoinformatics and Computer Science, more likely an offwork project than a serious one***

Heavily inspired by:
* Game Engine Architecture - Jason Gregory -  2nd Edition - 2014
* Game Coding Complete - McShraffry & Graham -  4th Edition - 2012

Possible Features to learn:
* Trees (Quad, Octa, R, R*, B, B*)
* RNGs
* Vulkan in 2D/3D
* Shaders
* P2P Networking
* Scripting (Lua)
* UI
